# Personalized Real Estate Recommender
This is the real estate recommendation system that I built for my final project during the Galvanize Data Science Intesive.

In short, the recommender is designed to help a person who is moving from one city to another, find a place to live. 
This is accomplished by serving two listings at the same time and allowing the user to choose the one they like the best.

The results are recorded and used to learn the users preference for certain types of homes.

This repo is a work in progress and is continually updated as I make progress on my project.
