The interior and exterior are made with quality materials and the builders were meticulious about building a solid, square and high quality house. What can I say about radiant heat floors! They keep the house warm with no nasty noise or ""stuff"" floating through the air. The builders added lots of extra touches including lighting in really great places. The short walk to ""all things Ballard"" is awesome. I leave the car at home all weekend. It is also close to local parks and even though it's blocks from Market Street, the neighborhood is incredibly quiet. I've also had a 400 square foot outdoor patio professionally tiled with 2'x'2' concrete tiles. It's like an extra large room outdoors. Perfect for summer parties. There's no up-keep, just clean the house and go! Also this is a HOUSE, not a townhouse or condo. No dues, you own the property as well. ",48823195

Maximum lot coverage is 45% (50% for townhomes) and up to 65% lot coverage.

Neighborhood Description

The property is located in the south Queen Anne Hill neighborhood blocks north of the Seattle Center and the downtown Seattle
city core. This hillside neighborhood is primarily older established homes (suburban utility with immediate urban amenities),
most of which have been fully renovated and/or upgraded. Due to the zoning along the southern rim of this neighborhood,
many of the older structures are being razed for new townhome or higher density construction. There are multiunit dwelling
opportunities along the periphery, as well as commercial and retail/entertainment opportunities. Due to the south sloping
hillside location, the predominant number of homes have varying degrees and quality of view amenity of the Seattle Center
(Space Needle), the city skyline, Lake Union or Elliot Bay, potential mountain range views to the east (Cascades) and west
(Olympics), and Mt Rainier (largest mountain in continental US).This property has convenient access to community support
services, shopping, restaurants, public schools, and city amenities and entertainment, all of which are within a 1/2 mile
radius. Access to arterials and freeways.

This is a fully remodeled and updated home of quality construction and finish grade with a detached studio/yoga room of similar finish and view quality on the western portion of the parcel. It was a full remodel with new windows to of varying shapes to enhance the immediate view of the Space Needle to the south and the Seattle downtown skyline, new roofing, newer furnace and hotwater systems, all new extensive exterior surround-decking, and full kitchen remodel. Quality materials were utilized throughout carrying a similar wood theme; brazilian walnut ipe hardwood flooring on both levels, wenge hardwood kitchen counters and bath counters, custom hickory cabinetry and new quality appliances, all new solid core doors with an imported solid wood property entry door to the property from Bali, custom lighting and accent lighting, etc.
The home is laid out to maximize the very good Seattle view from both levels and the surrounding deck with glass railings enhances view from the entire length of the property (from yoga room in the west to the open deck hot tub layout to the east).
The property is partially enclosed to the north in bamboo hedges and the western portion is very well designed and landscaped with stone patio, water features, carved wood benches & planters, etc (See photos). Although the home has the potential for significant expansion, both vertically and horizontally, it will continue to compete well in the surrounding market place due to its quality, layout, view amenity, and very good location (Immediately proximate to the Seattle Center and on a dead-end road with no traffic influence).

The entry of the condo is characterized by a set of double doors, perfect for transporting larger pieces of furniture in and out. Polished hardwood floors line the entryway and extend to the corridor, kitchen, and dining room. An assortment of quaint features such as a lazy Susan in one of the kitchen cupboards, track lighting in the bedroom and living room, and full length mirrors on all the bedroom closet doors add a level of uniqueness and distinguishment to the home. The living room, master bedroom, and one of the auxiliary rooms are all connected to private balconies. Each room enjoys spaciousness and ceiling to floor windows which further integrate the condo into the natural beauty directly outside. Speaking of natural beauty, the dozens of trees which surround the unit not only contribute to the seclusion and privacy of the condo, but also keep the interior cool even on Seattle's hottest days. With a walk-in closet in the master, another in the living room, as well as a storage unit in the building lobby provided by Sixty 01 alongside two covered parking spaces, storage is not likely to be an issue.

Neighborhood Description

Beautiful scenic (""Viewpoint"") neighborhood!  Take 520 here get off on NE 40th, walk around Idylwood park, drive along West Lake Sammamish and to the Shops at Redmond Center.  Drive around Marymoor Park. Cirque du Soleil, films and concerts play at Marymoor. This is one of the most affordable homes available in a top neighborhood thanks to ancient management problems--however anthropologists have cleared away the cavemen/women/saber-tooths.  2 New Medical clinics opened in the city.  Drive around it looks like a well-managed city! Courteous neighbors and drivers on the road.  Microsoft is one of 4 companies in the USA to have 'AAA' rating---higher than the U.S Govt!  This area has been a treasure in good times and a haven in the bad.  Commute to Amazon, Nintendo wii, Starbucks, Costco, even Zillow, big orders at Boeing, small medical companies. This part of the country is getting hotter...don't wait too long.

Neighborhood Description

This home is located on a well maintained but less used street. Within one block is the City of Burien's Community Center, a community garden, Dottie Harper Park, and a skate park/sports field. The street is the boarder between the neighborhood of Chelsea Park, a community of winding streets and postwar homes full of longtime residents and new homeowners, and the neighborhood of Dottie Harper Park, an area that has historically been the home of a number of community events such as Burien's Wild Strawberry Festival, sporting events, art shows, the Burien Actors Theatre, Burien's Arts-a-Glow Lantern Festival, the B-Town Brewfest, as well as many other events and has recently been proposed as Burien's new Arts and Cultural district. 

There are a number of schools, stores, gas stations, restaurants, and coffee shops within one mile of the home including Burien's Town Square neighborhood which is home to a number of local and independent businesses, Burien City Hall, Burien's largest library, and Burien Town Square Park.

The home is also located within walking distance to a number of bus routes and the Burien Park and Ride which is the area's main transit center for buses into Seattle, Bellevue, and Tacoma.
